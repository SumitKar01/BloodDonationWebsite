                    About Rokto
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Rokto is a website for people who want to donate blood and receive blood. This website is a
                    place where voluntary blood donors can list themselves as donors, and people who need
                    blood can easily find these voluntary blood donors and contact them. By this, both parties are
                    benefited. Rokto makes it easy to get the contact information of blood donors without any
                    hassle. As when someone is searching for a donor, they donâ€™t even have to open an account
                    and waste time on that. They can just put their location and the blood group they need, and
                    they will find a list of contact information of the donors. Rokto also makes it easy for blood
                    donors as sometimes they can be unavailable or not in a position to donate blood. To help
                    with that, donors can change their status, not show their contact information. And Rokto makes
                    sure the user can easily remove their account if they want to, as Rokto respects user choice.
